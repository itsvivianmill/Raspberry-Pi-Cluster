Overall, this project has been a great learning experience where we created a Raspberry Pi Cluster, dual-booted a NUC, configured a Cisco firewall, and launched an HTTP flood attack. We faced obstacles but overcame them together as this marks the end of our Raspberry Pi 400 Cluster project. 

From the beginning of October, we can say that it was an overwhelming task to start from nothing but the materials we had in hand. It took weeks for us to get started and even took time off because of other work, but in the end, we would always make progress at the end of the day. It took so much research and documentation, however, QVL has something amazing to offer.
