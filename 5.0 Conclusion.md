<h2>5.0 Conclusion</h2>
Overall, this project has been a great learning experience! We created a Raspberry Pi Cluster, dual-booted a NUC, configured a Cisco firewall, launched an HTTP flood attack, and most of all TROUBLESHOOTING. We faced many obstacles but overcame them together. One of the hardest aspects of the project was learning new things while under a timeline (no matter how flexible it was, the pressure to get it done was still present).

From the beginning of October, we can say that it was an overwhelming task to start building something from nothing. There were times we had to remind ourselves where we left off since it was impossible to work on the project consistently, juggling between other projects and school. It took a lot of research and documentation, but at the same time very worthwhile.

This marks the end of our QVL Networking Project (although it will always be a work in progress).
