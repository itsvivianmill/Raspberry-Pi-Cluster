<h2>3.0 ASA 5506-X Firewall Configuration</h2>

<h3>Cisco ASA 5505 Firewall Fail</h3>

Obstacles:
Funny enough, we received our Cisco ASA 5505 firewall and when we tried to boot it up, we ran across some problems! The compact flash was messed up, which means it technically doesn’t have an operating system. The error we got was: i2c_write_byte_w_suspend() error, slot = 0x0, device = 0x40, address = 26 byte count = 1. Reason: I2C_UNPOPULATED_ERROR. 
*From the Cisco forums that we read, this issue is usually resolved by RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization).*
<br>
<br>
*However, we did want to see if we could resolve this issue ourselves. We were able to ROM into it and changed the confreg to 0x110003 (which didn’t do much).*

<h3>Cisco ASA 5506-X Firewall Obtained</h3>
Connecting to the ASA firewall

1. Putty
   - Change to Serial
2. Device Manager
   - Check which COM number

We ordered a new firewall and to avoid any mishaps, we got the Cisco ASA 5506-X instead. Everything was able to boot up fine and was able to be configured.

Hostname: CiscoASA

Outside IP address:

Inside IP address: 10.0.0.0/8

First, we tried to set up static routing from Barbie to the Raspberry Pi Cluster, so we chose to disconnect Barbie from the internet. Although we have some experience with configuring routers and switches, configuring the ASA firewall was something different. Then we found out that we didn't need to configure static routing because it was already directly connected, so we just needed to work on configuring ACLs. 

<h3>Configuring Firewall</h3>
To help visualize, we used Cisco Packet Tracer to create a mockup of our network because it would be easier to troubleshoot.

In reference to our Version 3 Project Plan and the Packet Tracer, we first configured interface g1/1 to be named DMZ and designate that area to be where the Raspberry Pi Cluster would be located logically. We gave it the IP address of 172.30.212.1/24 (which was the default gateway). Then we configured interface g1/2 to be named inside which would have NUC 1 (Barbie). The IP address of that network would be 10.0.0.254/8 (meaning we changed Barbie's IP address as well to simulate an internal network).
