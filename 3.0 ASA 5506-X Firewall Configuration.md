<h2>3.0 ASA 5506-X Firewall Configuration</h2>

<h3>3.1: Cisco ASA 5505 Firewall Fail</h3>

Funny enough, we received our Cisco ASA 5505 firewall that we ordered specifically for the project, but immediately ran into problems when booting it up! When we plugged in the firewall (following the instructions, of course), it made a spark and the room started to smell a little bit like smoke (whoops!). The firewall wouldn't boot up at all at first, but by some miracle, it started up. Of course that wasn't the end of it: the compact flash was messed up, which meant it technically didnâ€™t have an operating system. The error we got was: i2c_write_byte_w_suspend() error, slot = 0x0, device = 0x40, address = 26 byte count = 1. Reason: I2C_UNPOPULATED_ERROR.

*From the Cisco forums that we read, this issue is usually resolved by RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) which is what we ended up doing.*

<h3>3.2: Cisco ASA 5506-X Firewall Obtained</h3>
We ordered a new firewall and to avoid any mishaps, we ordered the Cisco ASA 5506-X instead. Everything was able to boot up fine and was able to be configured (we used PuTTY to connect):
<br>
<br>

1. Hostname: CiscoASA
2. Outside IP address: 11.0.0.254/24
3. Inside IP address: 10.0.0.0/8

First, we tried to set up static routing from Barbie to the Raspberry Pi Cluster, so we chose to disconnect Barbie from the internet. Although we have some experience with configuring routers and switches, configuring the ASA firewall was something different. Then we found out that we didn't need to configure static routing because it was already directly connected, so we just needed to work on configuring ACLs. 

<h3>3.3: Configuring Firewall</h3>
To help visualize, we used Cisco Packet Tracer to create a mockup of our network because it would be easier to troubleshoot.

In reference to our Version 3 Project Plan and the Packet Tracer, we first configured interface g1/1 to be named DMZ and designate that area to be where the Raspberry Pi Cluster would be located logically. We gave it the IP address of 172.30.212.1/24 (which was the default gateway). Then we configured interface g1/2 to be named inside which would have NUC 1 (Barbie). The IP address of that network would be 10.0.0.254/8 (meaning we changed Barbie's IP address as well to simulate an internal network).

The next step was to focus on the access list. We created an extended access-list called dmz-to-inside to permit ICMP echo reply so that we could ping the Raspberry Pi Cluster. Then the access list was applied to the DMZ interface (g1/1) and when the interfaces were being configured, we saw that there were already security-levels which meant that we didn't need to configure as much.

Security-levels are a way to describe the level of trust that a user has, so we decided to change the DMZ security-level from 0 to 50 and kept the inside security-level 100. Here are more details about it:

We also created another access-list that was called outside-to-dmz in interface outside to allow HTTP port 3111 so that the other devices could access the web server. 

We found out that HTTP flooding was very effective but we didn't have any of the Firepower services from the ASA 5506-X, so we only had rate limiting as an option. However, the problem with rate limiting is that it cannot differentiate between different IP addresses (there could be manual configuration but it can only go so far). 

There was a discovery where we found out that the web server still utilized port 80, so that meant that we could DoS it and make an even bigger impact while having the firewall block it by removing a line on our access-list outside-to-dmz (because of implicit deny). In reference to our Low Orbit Ion Cannon section, we discovered this by using the recoil method on the software. 

However, this solution is not perfect because we could just change the port number on LOIC and still increase the CPU capacity. Although it is not a perfect solution, it can still demonstrate the idea of filtering traffic with a firewall and protecting an internal device.
