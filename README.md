  Preface: 
</h2>

*This is documentation that records our process of trying to configure and troubleshoot a network security simulation. This is NOT a step-to-step tutorial but rather documents our thought process, changes, problems, and failures that we have encountered when working on this project. 
The overall arching goal of this project is to understand how to build and configure a network— but also with a few extra challenges sprinkled into it (i.e. network security). The other thing to note is that this project encompasses configuring Cisco routers, switches, and firewalls. pfSense was an option for this project; however, we all wanted to get acquainted with Cisco since it is a leader in the networking industry and many competitions we’ve participated in have always had Cisco networking challenges.*
