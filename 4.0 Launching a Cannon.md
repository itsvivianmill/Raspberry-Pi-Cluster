We decided to use the Low Orbit Ion Cannon software on a Kali VM on Quan's laptop to flood our cluster with TCP packets, specifically targeting masterbibble. This is to represent a DoS attack and test the limits of our Cluster. Surprisingly, our Cluster was pretty good and handled 200 mbps, but the CPU usage went from 2% to 50%.

We later changed the protocol to HTTP because it is more effective in maxing out the CPU usage of the server. When it was changed the CPU capacity went from 2% to 100%.
