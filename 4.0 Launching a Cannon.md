<h2>4.0 Launching a Cannon:</h2>
We decided to use the Low Orbit Ion Cannon software on a kali VM on Quan's laptop to flood our cluster with TCP packets, specifically targeting masterbibble. This is to represent a DoS attack and test the limits of our Cluster. Surprisingly, our Cluster was pretty good and handled 200 mbps, but the CPU usage went from 2% to 50%.
