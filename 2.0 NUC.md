<h2>2.0 Next Unit of Computing (NUC)</h2>

<h3>2.1: Windows 11 Barbie</h3>
We used Rufus to set up the OS we put on the NUCs by using the following tutorial: https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-windows-11-without-microsoft-account 

Named it “Barbie”

<h3>2.2: Ubuntu Barbie</h3>
We decided to dual-boot Windows 11 with Ubuntu 22 so that it could access Rancher and the same method was used to install Windows 11. The partition was shrunk by 97 GB to give some space to the Ubuntu OS.

The OS successfully connected to the cluster and we updated and upgraded it.
Ubuntu Barbie was a unique internal device because whenever we needed to access the internet for screenshots or downloads, we would unplug the ethernet cable connected to the firewall and then connect the cable to the ethernet jack. 

<h3>2.3: Kali Preminger</h3>
The setup for the attacker NUC was pretty simple. We booted up the latest version of Kali onto it and downloaded the Low Orbit Ion Cannon, this time however, the school network blocked it (for obvious reasons). Quan opened up his hotspot, but there were complications with the executable after we completed all the steps. 
Gave it the IP address of 11.0.0.1/24
